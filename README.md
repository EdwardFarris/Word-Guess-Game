### **Description:**
 One of my first bootcamp assignments requiring the use of javascript to add functionality to a page. This is a hangman-like game that prompts players to guess a secret word. The overall theme is U.S. State names. Empty letter spaces are populated when players choose correct letters, eventually revealing the secret word. Players are limited to 10 incorrect guesses before losing the game. Secret words are randomized each round. The game keeps track of player wins, letters guessed, and number of remaining choices. Players can choose the same letter more than once without consequence.    <br>
